# PiTheremin
Here's some very basic code to get a theremin like instrument working with a Rasberry Pi and a Lidar sensor. 
Use at your own risk, this project is no longer maintained, but shared in hope it may be useful. 

I think crontab has the startup script, I'm not 100% sure. 

You need a rotary dila , a  OLED and a Lidar sensor to get this working

I started working on a Scematic, but didn't finish it:
Schematics/TouchLessMidi.fzz
OLED:

PS: To get this to work you ether want to turn your Pi into a USB midi device or use my other project to transmit Midi over bluetooth.

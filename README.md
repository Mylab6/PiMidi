# PiMidi
Here's some very basic code to get a theremin like instrument working with a Rasberry Pi and a Lidar sensor. 
Use at your own risk, this project is no longer maintained, but shared in hope it may be useful. 

Use startScript.sh to start it up, you can manually trigger this or set it as a start script

PS: To get this to work you ether want to turn your Pi into a USB midi device or use my other project to transmit Midi over bluetooth.
